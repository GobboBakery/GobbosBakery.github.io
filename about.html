      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I grew up watching AMVs and edits, and I’ve always loved the creativity people pour into them. Eventually, I wanted to make my own weird, fun, sometimes sexy content—mixing music, video, and whatever pops into my goblin brain.</p>
      <p>NSFW content always intrigued me—not just because it's sexy, but because it’s a space where fantasy, mood, and expression collide. This project lets me explore those feelings, experiment, and just have fun with the things that inspire me.</p>

Eventually, I wanted to make my own weird, fun, sometimes sexy content—mixing music, video, and whatever pops into my goblin brain.</p><p>NSFW content always intrigued me—not just because it's sexy, but because it’s a space where fantasy, mood, and expression collide. This project lets me explore those feelings, experiment, and just have fun with the things that inspire me.</p>`,
      `<h1>My Content</h1><p>I create NSFW edits driven by emotion, rhythm, and storytelling. Editors like RawSource and Rondoudou Media have heavily influenced my approach.</p><p>The music I use supports the pacing and visual structure—it’s not a product I’m distributing or selling. I operate entirely within Fair Use principles, with full respect for both visual and musical creators.</p><p>My priority is to credit, uplift, and financially support the NSFW artists who inspire this work. This project exists to celebrate—not compete with—their contributions.</p>`,
      `<h1>Creative Ethos</h1><p>My work is rooted in Fair Use, remix culture, and deep respect for the original creators behind the content I use. Every edit is carefully crafted with transformative intent—reimagining, not replacing.</p><p>While not a commercial venture in the traditional sense, this project does help me cover essential costs, like basic services and platform fees. It’s a passion-driven hobby—fueled by love for the NSFW community—that gives me space to contribute creatively and support others in the process.</p><p>This isn’t about monetizing art I didn’t make. It’s about curating experiences, exploring sensuality, and celebrating the incredible artists who make all of this possible.</p>`,
      `<h1>Respect & Removal</h1><p>All featured content is used with transformative intent and in accordance with Fair Use principles. However, I fully acknowledge the rights of original creators.</p><p>If you are the legal copyright holder of any material included in my edits and wish to have it removed, you may submit a takedown request through the appropriate contact form or email.</p><p>To protect both parties, I may request reasonable verification of authorship before proceeding. This is a necessary step to prevent impersonation and ensure that requests are legitimate.</p><p>Once verified, your content will be removed in a timely manner, without the need for further justification or dispute.</p><p>You can reach me through the Contact page.</p>`,
      `<h1>Get Involved</h1><p>I make spicy little things—FapHeroes, interactive pleasure, edits in crispy 4K—all designed to make you <em>feel</em> something. Lust? Joy? That weird tingle behind your knees? Good.</p><p>My edits are for anyone chasing connection through fantasy. 4K visuals, synced toys, FapHero beats, and a little goblin magic to tie it all together.</p><p>Doesn’t matter who you are or what you’re into—black, white, gay, bi, masc, femme, something in-between or off-the-map—I don’t care what flavor you are, just bring your curiosity.</p><p><strong>Lose yourself in the rhythm—of pleasure, of passion, of glorious release.<br>It’s time to bust a move.</strong></p>`,
